## Overview - focusing on faster performance

The concept of Verge Store is inspired by [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) and [ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift).

Recenlty, [facebookexperimental/Recoil](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil) has been opened.  
Atoms and Selectors similar to `Derived`.

Plus, releasing from so many definition of the actions.<br>
To be more Swift's Style on the writing code.

`store.myOperation()` instead of `store.dispatch(.myOperation)`

The characteristics are

* Method based dispatching action
* Separating the code in a large app
* Emits any events that isolated from State It's for SwiftUI's onReceive\(:\)
* Logging \(Commit, Performance monitoring\)
* Binding with Combine and RxSwift
* Normalizing the state with ORM
* Multi-threading

<details><summary>üåü Differences between other Flux libraries in iOS</summary>
<p>

Firstly, Verge provides the functions to keep excellent performance in using Store-Pattern.

Verge focuses on using in the real-world.

For example, the application must have many features depends on its business.<br>
Such as the application might be getting complicated.

To solve this issue, we can choose Store-Pattern such as flux.

At a glance, Flux architecture is amazing.<br>
However, we have to follow the disadvantages behind it.

They are coming from the application runs with Data-Driven (Mostly).<br>
Data-Driven will cause some expensive calculations in the application that depends on the complexity of the application.<br>
Sometimes, we may face some performance issues we can't overlook it.

Redux and Vuex are already following that.

- Redux
  - reselect
  - ORM
- Vuex
  - Getters
  - ORM

Verge is trying to do that in iOS application with Swift.

Specifically:
- Derived (Similar to [facebookexperimental/Recoil](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil)'s Atom and Selector)
- ORM

    Group {
      Text(store.state.name)
      Text(store.state.age)
    }
  }
}
```

## üçê Basic Usage

To start to use Verge in our app, we use these domains:

* **State**
  * A type of state-tree that describes the data our feature needs.
* **Activity**
  * A type that describes an activity that happens during performs the action.
  * This instance won't be stored in anywhere. It would help us to perform something by event-driven.
  * Consider to use this depends on that if can be represented as a state.
  * For example, to present alert or notifcitaions by the action.
* **Action**
  * Just a method that a store or dispatcher defines.
* **Store**
  * A storage object to manage a state and emit activities by the action.
  * Store can dispatch actions to itself.
* **Dispatcher (Optional)**
  * A type to dispatch an action to specific store.
  * For a large application, to separate the logics each domain.
  
**Setup a Store**
  
Define a state
  
```swift
struct MyState {
  var count = 0
}
```

Define an activity

```swift
enum MyActivity {
  case countWasIncremented
}
```

Define a store that uses defined state and activity

```swift
class MyStore: Store<MyState, MyActivity> {

  init(dependency: Dependency) {
    super.init(initialState: .init(), logger: nil)
  }
  
}
```

We can create an instance from `Store` but we can put some dependencies (e.g. API client) with creating a sub-class of `Store`.

(If you don't need Activity, you can set `Never` there.)

And then, add an action in the store

```swift
class MyStore: Store<MyState, MyActivity> {

  init(dependency: Dependency) {
    super.init(initialState: .init(), logger: nil)
  }
  
  func incrementCount() {
    commit { 
      $0.count += 1
    }
  }
}
```

Yes, this point is most different with Redux. it's close to Vuex.<br>
Store knows what the application's needs.

For example, call that action.

```swift
let store = MyStore(...)
store.incrementCount()
```

There are some advantages:

- **Better Performance**
  - Swift can perform this action with Swift's method dispatching instead switch-case computing. 
- **Returns anything we need**
  - the action can return anything from that action (e.g. state or result)
  - If that action dispatch async operation, it can return `Future` object. (such as Vuex action)
  
Perform a commit asynchronously

```swift
func incrementCount() {
  DispatchQueue.main.async {
    commit { 
      $0.count += 1
    } 
  }
}
```

Send an activity from the action

```swift
func incrementCount() {
  commit { 
    $0.count += 1
  }
  send(.countWasIncremented)
}
```

**Use the store in SwiftUI**

(Currently, Verge's development is focusing on UIKit.)

```swift
struct MyView: View {
  
  @EnvironmentObject var store: MyStore
  
  var body: some View {
    Group {
      Text(store.state.name)
      Text(store.state.age)
    }
    .onReceive(session.store.activityPublisher) { (activity) in
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

**Use the store in UIKit**

In UIKit, UIKit doesn't work with differentiating.<br>
To keep better performance, we need to set a value if it's changed.

Verge publishes an object that contains previous state and latest state, Changes object would be so helpful to check if a value changed.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
  let store: MyStore
  
  var cancellable: VergeAnyCancellable?
  
  init(store: MyStore) {
    ...
    
    self.cancellable = store.sinkChanges { [weak self] changes in
      self?.update(changes: changes)
    }
    
  }
            
  private func update(changes: Changes<MyStore.State>) {
    
    changes.ifChanged(\.name) { (name) in
      nameLabel.text = name
    }
    
    changes.ifChanged(\.age) { (age) in
      ageLabel.text = age.description
    }
    
  }
}
```





## ‚òÇÔ∏è Advanced Usage - to keep performance and scalability

**Adding a cachable computed property in a State**

We can add a computed property in a state to get a derived value with stored property,<br>
and that computed property works fine as well other stored property.

```swift
struct MyState {
  var items: [Item] = [] {
  
  var itemsCount: Int {
    items.count
  }
}
```

However, this patterns might cause an expensive cost of operation depends on how they computes. <br>
To solve it, Verge arrows us to define the computed property with another approach.

```swift
struct MyState: ExtendedStateType {

  var name: String = ...
  var items: [Int] = []
  
  struct Extended: ExtendedType {
    let filteredArray = Field.Computed<[Int]> {
      $0.items.filter { $0 > 300 }
    }
    .ifChanged(selector: \.largeArray)
  }
}
```

```swift
let store: MyStore

store.changes.computed.filteredArray
```

This defined computed array calculates only if changed specified value.<br>
That condition to re-calculate is defined with `.ifChanged` method in the example code.

And finally, it caches the result by first-time access and it returns cached value until if the source value changed.


**Making a slice of the state (Selector)**

We can create a slice object that derives a data from the state.

```swift
let derived: Derived<Int> = store.derived(.map(\.count))

// take a value
derived.value

// subscribe a value changes
derived.sinkChanges { (changes: Changes<Int>) in 
}
```

[Details here](https://muukii-app.gitbook.io/verge/docs-vergestore/derived-bindingderived)

**Creating a Dispatcher**

Store arrows us to define an action in itself, that might cause gain complexity in supporting a large application.<br>
To solve this, Verge offers us to create an object that dispatches an action to the store.<br>
We can separate the code of actions to keep maintainability.<br>
that also help us to manage a different type of dependencies.<br>

For example, the case of those dependencies different between logged-in and logged-out.

```swift
class MyDispatcher: MyStore.Dispatcher {
  func moreOperation() {
    commit {
      ...
    }
  }
}

let store: MyStore
let dispatcher = MyDispatcher(target: store)
```

Additionally, We can create a dispatcher that focuses the specified sub-tree of the state.<br>
You can check the detail of this from [our documentation](https://muukii-app.gitbook.io/verge/docs-vergestore/dispatcher).

### üì¶ VergeORM

It provides the function that manages performant many entity objects.<br>
Technically, using Normalization.

In the application that uses many entity objects, we sure highly recommend using such as ORM using Normalization.

## Prepare moving to SwiftUI from now with Verge

SwiftUI's concept is similar to the concept of React, Vue, and Elm. <br>
Therefore, the concept of state management will become to be similar as well.

That is Redux or Vuex and more.

Now, almost of iOS Applications are developed on top of UIKit.<br>
And We can't say SwiftUI is ready for top production. <br>
However, it would change.

It's better to use the state management that fits SwiftUI from now. It's not only for that, current UIKit based applications can get more productivity as well.

## Installation

With Cocoapods,

VergeStore

```ruby
pod 'Verge/Store'
```

VergeORM

```ruby
pod 'Verge/ORM'
```

VergeRx

```ruby
pod 'Verge/Rx'
```

These are separated with subspecs in Podspec.<br>
After installed, these are merged into single module as `Verge`.

To use Verge in your code, define import decralation following.

```swift
import Verge
```

# ü™ê State and shape

## Using single state tree \(Not enforced\)

VergeStore uses a **single state-tree. \(Recommended\)**  
That means an object contains all of the application's state.  
With this, we can get to achieve **"single source of truth"**

```swift
struct State: StateType {
  
  var count: Int = 0
  
}
```

That state is managed by **Store**.  
It process updating the state and notify updated events to the subscribers.

{% hint style="info" %}
VergeStore does support multiple state-tree as well.  
Depending on the case, we can create another Store instance.
{% endhint %}

## Add computed property

If you have a property that does not need to be stored, that can be computed with other property.

```swift
struct State: StateType {
  
  var count: Int = 0
  
  var countText: String {
    return count.description
  }
  
}
```

Although in some of cases, the cost of computing might be higher which depends on how it create the value from stored properties.

You can see one of the solutions from link below.

## StateType protocol helps to modify

VergeStore provides `StateType` protocol as a helper.

It will be used in State struct that Store uses.  
`StateType` protocol is just providing the extensions to mutate easily in the nested state.

Just like this.

```swift
public protocol StateType {
}

extension StateType {

  public mutating func update<T>(target keyPath: WritableKeyPath<Self, T>, update: (inout T.Wrapped) throws -> Void) rethrows where T : VergeStore._VergeStore_OptionalProtocol

  public mutating func update<T>(target keyPath: WritableKeyPath<Self, T>, update: (inout T) throws -> Void) rethrows

  public mutating func update(update: (inout Self) throws -> Void) rethrows
}
```

## Normalization

**If you put the data that has relation-ship or complicated structure into state tree,   
it would be needed normalization to keep performance.  
  
Please check VergeORM module**

## Subscribing the state

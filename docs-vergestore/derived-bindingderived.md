## Computing derived data from state tree

{% hint style="info" %}
**Derived** is inspired by [redux/reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect).
{% endhint %}

Derived's functions are:

* Computes the derived data from the state tree
* Emit the updated data with updating Store
* Supports subscribe the data
* Supports Memoization

## Overview

### Setting up the Store

```swift
struct State {
  var title: String = ""
  var count: Int = 0
}

let store = StoreBase<State, Never>(initialState: .init(), logger: nil)
```

### Create a Derived

```swift
let derived: Derived<Int> = store.derived(.map { $0.count })
```

### Subscribe the Derived

```swift
let cancellable = derived.subscribeChanges { (changes: Changes<Int>) in 
}
```

#### with Combine

```swift
derived
  .changesPublisher()
  .sink { (changes: Changes<Int>) in
  
  }
```

#### with RxSwift

```swift
derived.rx
  .changesObservable()
  .subscribe(onNext: { (changes: Changes<Int>) in
  
  })
```

## Memoization to keep performance

Mostly Derived is used for projecting the specified shape from the source object.  
  
And some cases may contain an expensive operation.  
In that case, we can consider to tune Memoization up.â€‹  
  
We can see the detail of Memoization from below link.

### Suppress the map operation that projects no changes

In create Derived method,  we can get the detail that how we suppress the no need updating and updated event. 

```swift
extension StoreType {

  public func derived<NewState>(
    _ memoizeMap: MemoizeMap<Changes<State>, NewState>,
    dropsOutput: @escaping (Changes<NewState>) -> Bool = { _ in false }
  ) -> Derived<NewState>
  
 }
```

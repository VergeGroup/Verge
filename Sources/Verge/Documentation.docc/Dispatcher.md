# ``Verge/DispatcherType``

Dispatcher allows us to update the state of the Store from away the store and to manage dependencies to create Mutation.

- Dispatcher is
    - it is an object.
    - it does not have its own state.
    - it can run commit with specified storeâ€™s state.
    - it can have a temporary dependency to commit the mutation.
    - it can focus on specified tree of the state.

Here is an example store, in this section we create a dispatcher to commit the mutation into this Store:

```swift
struct State: StateType {
  var count: Int = 0
}

enum Activity {
  case happen
}

final class MyStore: Store<State, Activity> {
  ...
}
```

MyStore has a typealias to define a dispatcher:

```swift
MyStore.Dispatcher
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Actual type of `MyStore.Dispatcher` is `DispatcherBase<State, Never>` It is a typealias to write shortly.

</aside>

## Define a dispatcher

Letâ€™s take a look how we create a dispatcher with using the typealias:

```swift
final class MyDispatcher: MyStore.Dispatcher {

}
```

Now we can create an instance of `MyDispatcher`:

```swift
let store = MyStore()
let dispatcher = MyDispatcher(targetStore: store)
```

## Add an action to the dispatcher

Next, we add an action that commits a mutation:

```swift
final class MyDispatcher: MyStore.Dispatcher {
  func doSomething() {
    commit {
      $0.count = 100
    }
  }
}
```

```swift
let store: MyStore
let dispatcher: MyDispatcher

dispatcher.doSomething()

store.state.count == 100 // true
```

## Add a dependency to dispatch an action

In the case of large applications, we need to handle many dependencies to run the application.
For example, if we use multiple HTTP clients.

```swift
final class MyDispatcher: MyStore.Dispatcher {

  let apiClient: APIClient

  init(apiClient: APIClient, targetStore: Store<RootState>) {
    self.apiClient = apiClient
    super.init(targetStore: targetStore)
  }

  // an example of fetching data and commit
  func fetchData() {
    apiClient.fetchData { [weak self] result in
      switch result {
      case .success(let data):
        let items = data.encode(...)
        self?.commit {
          $0.fetchedItems = items
        }
      case .failure(let error):
      // handles error
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To use this:

```swift
let store = MyStore()
let apiClient = APIClient()
let dispatcher = MyDispatcher(apiClient: apiClient, target: store)

dispatcher.fetchData()
```

Now we can handle multiple kinds of dependencies each it fits itself life-time.
For example, if you have a restriction that some dependencies can be created only the userâ€™s logging-in, you can create a dispatcher what is for.

Next section explains the detail.

## Create multiple Dispatcher

![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1888355/82821486-28586a00-9edf-11ea-8c98-062eafcc4f16.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1888355/82821486-28586a00-9edf-11ea-8c98-062eafcc4f16.png)

Creating a dispatcher does not have the restriction of the number of instances or types.
This means that it allows us to define a dispatcher and instantiate an instance of the dispatcher to fill the use-case.

For example, In case the timing of getting dependencies that to be needed by run Action or Mutation is different, itâ€™s not easy to have them in the one dispatcher with type-safety. they must be optional types.

Using creating multiple dispatchers techniques solves this case by defines the dispatcher each the timing of getting dependencies.

```swift
class LoggedInDispatcher: MyStore.Dispatcher {

  let apiClientNeedsAuthToken: APIClient = ...
  ...
}

class LoggedOutDispatcher: MyStore.Dispatcher {

  let apiClientWithoutAuthToken: APIClient = ...
  ...
}
```

```swift
let store = MyStore()
let loggedInDispatcher = LoggedInDispatcher(...)
let loggedOutDispatcher = LoggedOutDispatcher(...)
```

The application will create `LoggedInDispatcher` when the user is logged-in and deinitialize `LoggedOutDispatcher`.

## Create scoped dispatcher

As another feature what Dispatcher provides, It supports to commit specified scope of the state which helps to mutate with focus on a part of the large state tree.

Here is a sample state that assuming a large app.

- AppState (MyStore)
    - db: Database
    - loggedIn: LoggedInState
        - myInfo: MyInfoState
    - loggedOut: LoggedOutState

We have `database`, `logged-in` and `logged-out state`. `database` means normalized state shape to manage many entities.

In previous section, that explained we can multiple dispatchers each the userâ€™s state.
However, it needs to the full path to mutate where we need to mutate.

```swift
class LoggedInDispatcher: MyStore.Dispatcher {

  func performA() {
    commit {
      $0.loggedIn.xxx
    }
  }

  func performB() {
    commit {
      $0.loggedIn.xxx
    }
  }

  func performC() {
    commit {
      $0.loggedIn.xxx
    }
  }
}
```

LoggedInDispatcher will often dispatch some action for logged-in-state.
But it calls everytime `$0.loggedIn`, it seems a little bit verbosity.

That will be solved by `ScopedDispatcher`. It will move on target tree of the state when it dispatch the action.

The following code shows how we could create a `ScopedDispatcher`:

```swift
final class LoggedInService: MyStore.ScopedDispatcher<LoggedInState> {

  init(store: Store) {
    super.init(targetStore: store, scope: \.loggedIn)
  }

  func someOperation() {
    commit { (state: LoggedInState) in
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

In LoggedInService, commit mutates `LoggedInState` directly. Like this, we can create a dispatcher each use-cases.

### Detaching to other tree

Just in case, `ScopedDispatcher` supports also mutating on other state tree.

**Moving on more deeper**

```swift
final class LoggedInService: MyStore.ScopedDispatcher<LoggedInState> {

  func detachingOperation() {
    let myInfo = detached(by: \.myInfo)
    myInfo.commit { (state: MyInfo) in

    }
  }
}
```

**Detaches from root**

```swift
final class LoggedInService: MyStore.ScopedDispatcher<LoggedInState> {

  func detachingOperation() {
    let db = detached(from: \.db)
    db.commit { (state: Database) in

    }
  }
}
```

#  Mutation

## What Mutation is

The only way to actually change state in a Store is by committing a mutation. Define a function that returns Mutation object. That expresses that function is Mutation

Mutation does **NOT** allow to run asynchronous operation.

### Define mutations in the Store

```swift
struct MyState {
  var todos: [TODO] = []
}

class MyStore: Store<MyState, Never> {

  func addNewTodo(title: String) {
    commit { (state: inout InoutRef<MyState>) in
      state.todos.append(Todo(title: title, hasCompleted: false))
    }
  }

}
```

üí° If the commit has no modifications, Store skips the mutation.

### Run Mutation

```swift
let store = MyStore()
store.addNewTodo(title: "Create SwiftUI App")

print(store.state.todos)
// store.state.todos => [Todo(title: "Create SwiftUI App", hasCompleted: false)]
```

## Batches multiple commtis

Committing multiple mutations in a short time might decrease performance.
Because the subscribers around the store derive a state many times.

Like this,

```swift
class MyStore: Store<MyState, Never> {

  func myMutation() {
    if ... {
      commit {
        ...
      }
      // emits updated event
    }

    if ... {
      commit {
        ...
      }
      // emits updated event
    }

    if ... {
      commit {
        ...
      }
      // emits updated event
    }
  }

}
```

To keep better performance, we need to keep using fewer commits in a short time.

We have 2 ways.

### Using `commit`

``DispatcherType/commit(_:_:_:_:mutation:)`` provides ``InoutRef``, that can detect how the wrapped state will change.
If there is no change, `commit` does nothing and no emitting the events from the Store.

However, you should attention `commit` is atomically operation which means, the Store getting lock while committing.

```swift
func myMutation() {
  commit { (state: inout State) in
    if ... {
      state.aaa = ...
    }

    if ... {
      state.bbb = ...
    }

    if ... {
      state.ccc = ...
    }
  }
}
```
